Many molecular processes within a cell are dependents of PPIs. Some PPIs are involved in multiple aggregation-related diseases, such as Creutzfeldt–Jakob and Alzheimer's diseases. The discovery of novel molecules capable of inhibiting these processes can be of great importance for medicine.\n","\n","Small molecules are low molecular weight molecules that include lipids, monosaccharides, second messengers, other natural products and metabolites, as well as drugs and other xenobiotics.
